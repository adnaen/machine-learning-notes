# **Recurrent Neural Network**

- **It is a type of Neural Network, designed for sequential data.**
- **RNN maintain internal state that can be capture information from previous inputs.**
- **Mainly used for NLP Tasks, Time series**

# Type of RNN

|Types | Input | Output |
|----|---------|----------|
| One to One | single | Single| 
|One to Many | Single |Sequence |
|Many to One |Sequence |Single |
|Many to Many|Sequence | Sequence|

# Disadvantage
- RNN struggle with long sequences. which is why `LSTM` and `GRU`
