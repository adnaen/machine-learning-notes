# **Natural Language Processing**

1. `Traditional NLP` → Uses Machine Learning algorithms like Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and text classification.

2. `Advanced NLP` → Uses Deep Learning models like RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers (BERT, GPT) for more complex tasks like text generation, machine translation, and chatbot development.
