hat builds multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data and features, then combines their outputs (majority vote for classification, average for regression) to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

**Advantages**
- Handles large datasets and high dimensionality well.
- Works for both classification and regression.

**Disadvantages**
- Slower training time
