# Logistics Regression

- **About Logistics Regression**

1. Supervised Learning Model
2. Classification Model
3. Best for Binary Classification Problem
4. Uses Sigmoid function

- **Advantages**

1. Easy to implement
2. Performs well on data with linear relationship
3. Less prone to over-fitting for low dimensional dataset

- **Disadvantages**

1. High dimensional dataset (Dataset with more no.of features) causes over-fitting
2. Difficult to capture complex relationship in dataset
3. Sensitive to outliers
4. Needs larger dataset
