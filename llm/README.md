# **Large Language Model (LLM)**

in simply
- LLM is Large Neural Network (Transformer) for design, understand , generate and respond to human like **Text**.
- LLM is trained on huge amount of data.
- It have billions parameters while training (weights).

## Pre-Training
- Train a LLM with huge amount of data globally not specific.
- Goal: Understand the Language rules, Grammar and general word knowledge
- e.g. GPT. it a pre-trained model that understand human like natural language

## Fine-Tuning
- Take a Pre-trained model and train it with a specific context data in order to perform that LLM with that context
- e.g. ChatGPT . which is Fine-Tuned the GPT model to interact with humans
