# Terminologies in Deep Learning (Neural Network)

1. `Neuron` : A processing unit that takes inputs, applies weights, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output.
2. `Nodes` : Another name for a neuron in a neural network.
3. `Layer` : A group of neurons at the same level, including input, hidden, and output layers.
4. `Perceptron` : A simple neural unit that performs weighted summation and applies a step function for binary classification.
5. `Activation Function` : A function that introduces non-linearity, allowing neural networks to learn complex patterns (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).
6. `Summation` : The weighted sum of inputs and bias before applying the activation function.
